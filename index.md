## About

I am currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science within the framework of a joint thesis supervision between the University of Chile and the Institut Polytechnique de Paris. My current research interests include machine learning for anticipatory networking, user mobility, network privacy/security and QoS monitoring.
