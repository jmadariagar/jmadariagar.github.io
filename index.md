## About

I am working toward the PhD degree at the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.sciences.ncsu.edu) of the NC State University, under the supervision of [Patrick Combettes](https://pcombet.math.ncsu.edu). In 2022 I completed my MSc degree at the [Department of Mathematics Engineering](http://www.dim.uchile.cl) of the University of Chile under the supervision of [Héctor Ramírez](https://sites.google.com/site/hectorramirezhomepage/home). My current research interests include optimization and equilibrium, nonlinear analysis, convex optimization, and variational analysis.
